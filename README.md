# Inventory-Management-.
Inventory Management System built with Java + JDBC + MySQL supporting full CRUD operations for product data.
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based backend application designed to facilitate efficient tracking and management of product inventory. The system enables users to perform essential stock management operations such as adding new products, updating quantities, viewing product details, and deleting records. The application leverages JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for persistence and integrates with a MySQL relational database, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.

This project demonstrates backend development concepts including structured database interactions, CRUD functionality, exception handling, and modular code design. It is suitable for academic submissions, practical training, and foundational learning in database-driven software development.
